# GuildNet API Reference

This document lists the Host App HTTP API endpoints, per-cluster services and endpoints, cluster infrastructure components, and configuration options for both the cluster and the Host App server.

Note: the runtime behavior is implemented in `internal/api/router.go`, `internal/settings/settings.go`, and `pkg/config/config.go`.

## Host App server API endpoints

The Host App exposes an HTTP API (default listen is configurable; see Host App configuration). The important endpoints implemented in `internal/api/router.go` are below.

Authorization model: GET requests are open. Mutating requests require either a configured bearer token (Host App `Deps.Token`) in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or must originate from loopback (127.0.0.1 / ::1) when no token is set. Some endpoints also accept `X-API-Token` header.

- POST /bootstrap
  - Purpose: Accept a join payload (JSON or `guildnet.config`) and persist a cluster record and kubeconfig. Performs a bounded pre-warm (10s) to validate cluster API and RethinkDB (if Registry is present).
  - Request body (JSON):
    - tailscale: optional object matching `settings.Tailscale` (login_server, preauth_key, hostname)
    - cluster: optional object with fields:
      - kubeconfig (string) - required when attaching a cluster
      - name, namespace
      - api_proxy_url, api_proxy_force_http, disable_api_proxy
      - prefer_pod_proxy, use_port_forward
      - ingress_domain, ingress_class_name, workspace_tls_secret
      - cert_manager_issuer, ingress_auth_url, ingress_auth_signin
      - image_pull_secret, org_id
  - Response: JSON { clusterId: <id> } on success when kubeconfig provided.

- GET/PUT /settings/tailscale
  - Get or update global tailscale/tsnet settings. Payload uses `settings.Tailscale`.

- GET/PUT /settings/database
  - Get or update database connection settings (not commonly used in production).

- GET/PUT /settings/global
  - Get or update runtime global settings (`settings.Global`).

- GET/PUT /api/settings/cluster/{clusterID}
  - Purpose: per-cluster settings (persisted into per-cluster DB when available).
  - GET returns `settings.Cluster` for the cluster.
  - PUT accepts `settings.Cluster` fields to update runtime behavior and will write a `ConfigMap` named `guildnet-cluster-settings` into the cluster namespace `guildnet-system` when cluster clients are available. This configmap is used by in-cluster controllers to read runtime preferences.

- GET /api/jobs
  - List submitted jobs (or orchestration tasks).
- POST /api/jobs
  - Submit a job: body { kind: string, spec: map } -> returns jobId (accepted).
- GET /api/jobs/{id}
  - Get job status.
- POST /api/jobs/{id}?action=cancel
  - Cancel job (requires authorization).
- GET /api/jobs-logs/{id}
  - Return NDJSON job logs from local DB.
- WS /ws/jobs?id={jobId}
  - Subscribe to job logs via WebSocket.

- GET /api/audit
  - List audit records (read-only).

- GET /api/health
  - Host-level health summary. Returns collected `headscale` entries and `clusters` status objects, performing lightweight cluster checks for each cluster known in the Host App DB.

- POST/GET/DELETE /api/deploy/headscale and /api/deploy/headscale/{id}
  - Create/manage in-host headscale deployment records and orchestrate creation via jobs. Supports sub-actions via POST `?action=endpoint|preauth-key|health`.

- GET/POST /api/deploy/clusters
  - GET: list clusters persisted in Host App DB.
  - POST: create a cluster record (orchestration job for provisioning).

- GET/DELETE/POST /api/deploy/clusters/{id}
  - GET: cluster record (from Host App DB).
  - DELETE: remove cluster record.
  - POST actions (query param `action`) include:
    - attach-kubeconfig: body { kubeconfig: string } (validates kubeconfig and persists it under `credentials:cl:{id}:kubeconfig`)
    - health: check cluster reachability
    - kubeconfig: returns the persisted kubeconfig as YAML
    - other actions delegated as `cluster.<action>` jobs

- GET /ui-config
  - UI runtime config placeholder (returns {} in current implementation).

- Cluster proxied APIs (per-cluster path prefix: /api/cluster/{clusterID}/...)
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/published-services
    - List Host App published services (tailnet/tsnet published ports persisted in local DB).
  - DELETE /api/cluster/{id}/published-services/{service}
    - Remove a published service and stop the tsnet listener for it.
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/status
    - Quick cluster-local status (internal helper).
  - Proxy endpoint: /api/cluster/{id}/proxy/server/{serviceName}/... -> reverse proxy to the Service (via API proxy path or port-forward fallbacks).
    - This endpoint performs service discovery (Service -> Pod selection) and supports port-forward fallback, tsnet publishing, and streamable websocket proxying.
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/servers
    - List Workspaces (maps `Workspace` CRs to a simplified Server model: id, name, image, status, ports).
  - POST /api/cluster/{id}/workspaces
    - Create a Workspace CR in target cluster (body: workspace spec with image, env, ports, args, resources, labels). Returns { id, status } accepted if creation succeeded.
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/workspaces/{name}
    - Fetch Workspace CR object (unstructured) from cluster.
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/workspaces/{name}/logs
    - Aggregate pod logs for the workspace (returns list of log lines with timestamps).
  - DELETE /api/cluster/{id}/workspaces/{name}
    - Delete workspace CR (auth required for mutating)
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/workspaces/{name}/logs/stream
    - SSE / Event-stream of pod logs (text/event-stream)
  - GET /api/cluster/{id}/health
    - Cluster scoped health: checks k8s connectivity and RethinkDB presence (using Registry.RDBPresent).

- Per-cluster DB API (proxied): /api/cluster/{id}/db/... -> internally rewrites to /api/db/... and routes to the Host App DB API implementation (see `internal/httpx.DBAPI`).

- SSE path for changefeeds: /sse/cluster/{id}/db/... -> rewritten to /sse/db/...


## Per-cluster services and endpoints

The Host App interacts with several services in each cluster. The operator reconciles `Workspace` CRs into Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Ingresses, etc.). Key cluster services and their endpoints:

- Kubernetes API server
  - Used directly by Host App per-cluster clients (kubernetes.Clientset) and dynamic client for CRDs. Endpoint = kubeconfig's cluster server URL or per-cluster `APIProxyURL`.
  - When `APIProxyURL` is configured, the Host App will send API requests to that base URL (useful when the cluster API is fronted by an HTTP proxy or `kubectl proxy`).

- RethinkDB (per-cluster optional)
  - If a cluster includes an in-cluster RethinkDB for workspace-level state, the Host App attempts to locate it using Service LB IP, NodePort, or ClusterIP as configured. `Instance.EnsureRDB` performs the connection handshake.
  - The Host App exposes DB-management endpoints that operate on that DB via `/api/cluster/{id}/db/...`.

- Workspace Workloads (created by operator)
  - Deployments and Services created by the operator for each Workspace. Their service endpoints are typical k8s Service ClusterIP or LoadBalancer; the Host App proxies to them via:
    - /api/cluster/{id}/proxy/server/{serviceName}/... (service proxy)
    - If service endpoints are missing or preferPodProxy/usePortForward set, the Host App may port-forward to a pod and publish via tsnet.

- Ingress / LoadBalancer endpoints
  - If a Workspace is exposed via Service.type=LoadBalancer or an Ingress is created, the external ingress or LB IP is considered part of the cluster infra and will be used by clients and the Host App when present.


## Cluster infrastructure & configured components

These components are referenced in code and deployment manifests and are expected to be present or installed as part of `make deploy-k8s-addons` and `make deploy-operator` steps.

- CRDs
  - `workspaces.guildnet.io` (Workspace CRD)
  - `capabilities.guildnet.io` (Capabilities CRD)

- GuildNet Operator
  - Recommended: in-cluster Deployment in namespace `guildnet-system` (managed by `scripts/deploy-operator.sh` or `make deploy-operator`).
  - Functions: reconcile Workspace CRs into Deployments/Services, set Workspace.Status fields, create ConfigMap `guildnet-cluster-settings` for runtime settings.

- RethinkDB
  - Provided as `k8s/rethinkdb.yaml` for clusters that host RethinkDB for workspace persistence.
  - PersistentVolumeClaims must be bound for durability.

- MetalLB (optional for kind/local)
  - Used to provide LoadBalancer IPs for services in local/kind environments. Installed by `scripts/deploy-metallb.sh`.

- Cert-Manager / TLS
  - Clusters may use Cert-Manager to provision TLS for workspace ingress; Host App supports setting per-cluster `CertManagerIssuer` and `WorkspaceTLSSecret` settings.

- Network/Proxy components
  - Calico (or other CNI) — networking plugin; Host App is not dependent on a specific CNI, but debugging references Calico's IPAM issues.
  - Optional `kubectl proxy` / API proxy — Host App supports using a local kubectl proxy or explicit `APIProxyURL` to reach the API server.

- Headscale (optional)
  - Headscale can be orchestrated via Host App jobs to provide a private tailnet for cluster access. Headscale endpoints and preauth keys are stored in local DB and optionally used to configure tsnet connectors.


## Cluster configuration options (per-cluster settings)

Per-cluster settings are defined in `internal/settings/settings.go` (type `Cluster`) and persisted via `settings.Manager`.

- Name: human-friendly cluster label
- Namespace: default namespace for Workspace CRs (default `default`)
- APIProxyURL: optional base URL used instead of kubeconfig host (useful for kubectl-proxy or HTTP fronting)
- APIProxyForceHTTP: if true, force HTTP scheme when using APIProxyURL
- DisableAPIProxy: disable API proxy overrides for this cluster
- PreferPodProxy: prefer port-forward/pod proxying for service proxy endpoints
- UsePortForward: allow port-forward fallback when Service endpoints are missing
- IngressDomain: base domain used for creating Ingress resources for workspaces
- IngressClassName: ingress class to annotate ingresses (if creating Ingress)
- WorkspaceTLSSecret: name of TLS secret to use for workspace ingresses (if present)
- CertManagerIssuer: cert-manager issuer name to use for workspace TLS
- IngressAuthURL / IngressAuthSignin: optional OIDC/SSO hints used by the UI
- ImagePullSecret: optional imagePullSecret to attach to workspace pods
- WorkspaceLBEnabled: default to expose workspaces as LoadBalancer type (when true)
- OrgID: optional org scoping for multi-tenant configurations
- TSLoginServer / TSClientAuthKey / TSRoutes / TSStatePath / HeadscaleNS: per-cluster tailscale/headscale related settings for tsnet connectors

Notes:
- `PutCluster` will store `TSClientAuthKey` in the `credentials` bucket to avoid echoing it back in GET responses.
- `PutCluster` writes a `guildnet-cluster-settings` ConfigMap into the cluster namespace `guildnet-system` when Host App has cluster clients, enabling the in-cluster operator to read runtime flags.


## Host App configuration options (global and runtime)

Host App configuration lives in two areas:
- `pkg/config.Config` (persistent config file under `~/.guildnet/config.json`)
- Environment variables and runtime settings in `cmd/hostapp/main.go` and `internal/settings`.

### Persistent config (`pkg/config.Config` fields)

- LoginServer (string) — Tailscale login server URL (required)
- AuthKey (string) — Tailscale auth/preauth key (required)
- Hostname (string) — Host identifier for tailscale (required)
- ListenLocal (string) — Listener address for Host App (e.g. `127.0.0.1:8090`) (required)
- DialTimeoutMS (int) — dial timeout in milliseconds for outbound connections
- WorkspaceDomain, IngressClassName, WorkspaceTLSSecret, IngressAuthURL, IngressAuthSignin — legacy per-workspace/cluster hints (optional)

The config file path: `~/.guildnet/config.json` (created by tools like the init wizard)

### Environment variables / runtime flags

- GUILDNET_MASTER_KEY — required in production: a symmetric key used to encrypt Host App secrets stored in the local DB. Must be set in environment for the Host App process when running as a service.
- GN_EMBED_OPERATOR — when set to `1` (or truthy), Host App will start an embedded operator in-process. Do NOT set in production; in-cluster operator is recommended.
- GN_USE_GUILDNET_KUBECONFIG — opt-in for dev: when set, scripts like `scripts/run-hostapp.sh` will prefer `~/.guildnet/kubeconfig` as the source for `KUBECONFIG`.
- KUBE_PROXY_ADDR — explicit host:port or URL for a local kubectl proxy (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8001). When set, the Host App will allow enabling a per-cluster APIProxyURL fallback and will detect local proxy availability.
- LISTEN_LOCAL (or environment used to override `pkg/config.Config.ListenLocal`) — override the HTTP listener address
- Local cluster image/load variables — used by Makefile to build and load images for local clusters (prefer microk8s imports). See Makefile targets rather than environment-driven behavior for production.

### Runtime settings stored in localdb (via `settings.Manager`)

- `settings.Global` fields (persisted):
  - OrgID — default Org ID for new resources
  - FrontendOrigin — UI origin override
  - EmbedOperator — boolean persisted flag (but note GN_EMBED_OPERATOR environment variable controls startup-time embedded operator behavior)
  - DefaultNamespace — global default namespace for new clusters/workspaces
  - ListenLocal — fallback listener address persisted

- `settings.Cluster` — per-cluster runtime settings (see section above). `PutCluster` writes runtime configmap into cluster and persists to DB.


## Examples and notes

- Attach a cluster kubeconfig via API (curl example):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<host>:8090/api/deploy/clusters/<id>?action=attach-kubeconfig" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"kubeconfig": "<base64-or-raw-kubeconfig-content>"}'
```

- Create a workspace (simple job route delegates to Workspace CR creation):

```bash
curl -k -X POST "https://127.0.0.1:8090/api/cluster/<clusterID>/workspaces" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"image":"codercom/code-server:4.90.3","name":"verify-e2e"}'
```

- Proxy to a workspace service (example in-browser path):
  - https://hostapp.example.com/api/cluster/<clusterID>/proxy/server/<serviceName>/

- Important operational notes:
  - In production prefer in-cluster operator and do not rely on `GN_EMBED_OPERATOR`.
  - Do not rely on automatic local `kubectl proxy` detection in production; configure `APIProxyURL` per-cluster or set `KUBE_PROXY_ADDR` intentionally.
  - TLS certificates and `GUILDNET_MASTER_KEY` are required for secure production runs.
